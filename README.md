# SR-Books:

We have created a website for books that also can give you films related to the
book you are searching for.

## Website
[to-do-app](https://fack2.github.io/SR-Books/)

## File structer:

- Public:
  - style.css
  - Images
  - index.js
- index.html

## User Journey:

The user should be able to search for a book by entering its authour's name into
the input field.

When the user clicks on the search icon, it should bring out all the books
written by the specified author and if there are any movies based on the book it
should return them too.
